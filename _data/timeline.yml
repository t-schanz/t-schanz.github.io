- title: Free Data Science Contractor
  from: 2020
  to: 2021
  description: From contact, which I got to know during my time at AKRA, I was asked by a B2B company from hamburg to help them
          in integrating their data into a new management software. I was able to help them with the data integration
          and also with the development of a new data pipeline to structure their data in an efficient way.

- title: Data Science Consultant at AKRA GmbH
  from: 2019
  to: 2020
  description: After finishing my Masters I started working as a data scientist at AKRA. I worked on multiple projects
            for different customers, but my tasks mainly included data quality assurance, data analysis and 
            visualization, in terms of dashboards and reports. The few machine-learning tasks I worked on were mostly
            simple clustering (DBSCAN) and outlier detection (Isolation Forest). During this time I learnt a lot about
            databases (InfluxDB, PostgreSQL) and object relational mapping (SQLAlchemy). The main takeaway from this
            time for me was how to communicate my results in a structured way, but I realized that I wanted to focus 
            more on machine learning and less on data engineering.

- title: M.Sc. Meteorology at the University of Hamburg
  from: 2017
  to: 2019
  description: During my master studies I was given a lot more freedom in the courses to take than during the bachelors
            and so I found myself sitting in a lot of high performance computing and big data lectures. This led me to
            write my master thesis about the application of convolutional neural networks for processing raw radar
            measurements into radar echo maps. I found a way to train the neural network on synthetic data and then
            apply it to real world data. In the end, my model even outperformed the operational algorithm from the 
            University of Hamburg.

            <figcaption> The left image shows the result of my CNN, the right image shows the result of the operational
            algorithm. The CNN is able to resolve the structure of the precipitation much better than the operational
            algorithm.

- title: Research Cruise Over the Pacific Ocean
  from: 2019
  to: 2019
  description: I had the chance to participate in a six week long research cruise over the pacific ocean from Vancouver 
              (Canada) to 
              Singapore, as a student helper for the Max-Planck-Institute for Meteorology. There were two projects on 
              board of the ship "Sonne". The first was about microplastic in the ocean, the second
              was about onboard radiation measurements. I was part of the radiation team and we were able to collect
              a lot of useful data that could later be used to verify satellite measurements. An overview of the cruise
              can be found <a href="https://www.ldf.uni-hamburg.de/en/sonne/wochenberichte/wochenberichte-sonne/so267-2-268-3/so268-3-scr.pdf">here</a>.

- title: Max-Planck-Institute for Meteorology
  from: 2016
  to: 2019
  description: Nearly all the time during my studies I was working as a student helper at the Max-Planck-Institute for
              Meteorology. I started out doing smaller tasks like optimizing Python routines in terms of speed and
              memory usage. Later on I was able to work on my own projects, was in charge for data integrity and 
              developed a lot of useful tools for the scientists. Check out some of them in the <a href="../projects">projects</a> section.


- title: B.Sc. Meteorology at the University of Hamburg
  from: 2014
  to: 2018
  description: I was a student at the University of Hamburg from 2014 to 2018. I studied meteorology and wrote my 
              bachelor thesis about a new retrieval method for the estimation of water vapor in the atmosphere by using
              a combination of a radiation model (PSRad) and surface based measurements from the NASA (AERONET).
              To be fair, the retrieval did not work very well but I learnt how to set up a research project, how to
              work with unstructured data, how a radiation model works and how to write a scientific report.

              <figcaption> Using different atmospheric profiles in the radiation model for the retrieval, I show how my algorithm
                        performs compared to direct measurements from NASA. BSRN is my algorithm, AERONET is the NASA
                        measurement.
