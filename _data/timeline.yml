- title: Research Vessel Cruise
  from: 2019
  to: 2019
  description: I had the chance to participate in a research cruise over the pacific ocean from Vancouver (Canada) to 
              Singapore. There were two projects on board of the ship "Sonne". The first was about microplastic in the 
              ocean, the second
              was about onboard radiation measurements. I was part of the radiation team and we were able to collect
              a lot of useful data that could later be used to verify satellite measurements. An overview of the cruise
              can be found <a href="https://www.ldf.uni-hamburg.de/en/sonne/wochenberichte/wochenberichte-sonne/so267-2-268-3/so268-3-scr.pdf">here</a>.

- title: M.Sc. Meteorology at the University of Hamburg
  from: 2017
  to: 2019
  description: During my master studies I was given a lot more freedom in the courses to take than during the bachelors
            and so I found myself sitting in a lot of high performance computing and big data lectures. This led me to
            write my master thesis about the application of convolutional neural networks for processing raw radar
            measurements into radar echo maps. I found a way to train the neural network on synthetic data and then
            apply it to real world data. In the end, my model even outperformed the operational algorithm from the 
            University of Hamburg.

            <figcaption> The left image shows the result of my CNN, the right image shows the result of the operational
            algorithm. The CNN is able to resolve the structure of the precipitation much better than the operational
            algorithm.

- title: B.Sc. Meteorology at the University of Hamburg
  from: 2014
  to: 2018
  description: I was a student at the University of Hamburg from 2014 to 2018. I studied meteorology and wrote my 
              bachelor thesis about a new retrieval method for the estimation of water vapor in the atmosphere by using
              a combination of a radiation model (PSRad) and surface based measurements from the NASA (AERONET).
              To be fair, the retrieval did not work very well but I learnt how to set up a research project, how to
              work with unstructured data, how a radiation model works and how to write a scientific report.

              <figcaption> Using different atmospheric profiles in the radiation model for the retrieval, I show how my algorithm
                        performs compared to direct measurements from NASA. BSRN is my algorithm, AERONET is the NASA
                        measurement.
